# SECLAB_ECC

SECLAB_ECC is a collection with some scalar multiplication with countermeasures for the elliptic curve in Weierstrass and Twisted Edwards for. 

The following countermeasures are implemented:

* Double-And-Add-Always
* Montgomery-Ladder
* Randomised Sliding Window
* Randomised Scalar
* Randomised Scalar Splitting
* Projective Coordinate Randomis
*
